Ask how many rabbits they see each week and about their neutering advice. If they don’t see many rabbits very often or only suggest male neutering, they may not be fully up to speed with current best practice, so you may want to speak to another veterinary practice first."

		"heading":"L is for Love!",
		"info":"Rabbits are social creatures, and as a prey species are programmed to live with another. A solo bunny may well be lonely unless provided with much human contact, and even then our advice would be to find a partner if at all possible. The ideal partnership is a neutered male and a neutered female; why not visit your local reputable rabbit rescue to find your bunny some love and get some sound advice and help about bunny bonding – just like humans, their relationship can’t be hurried and needs experienced hands to oversee the bonding process."

		"info":"Sadly this man-made disease is rife and still kills many thousands of rabbits in the wild and domestic environments annually. It killed around 99% of rabbits when it was introduced into the UK in 1953. Once infected, a rabbit will develop lumps and swellings around the face and genitals, with secondary respiratory issues developing later. Death is slow and painful. Transmitted by biting insects such as fleas and mosquitoes. An annual vaccine is available to help prevent this dreadful disease, and this vaccine is a must for any domestic rabbit. Prevention is the only cure."

For example, around 80% of females will develop uterine cancer by the age of 4 unless neutered. There’s a very high risk of testicular cancer amongst males too. Both sexes can be very territorial if un-neutered, and this can manifest itself as fighting, area defending (even attacking a human if thought to be entering a defended area) and urine spraying being the most common. As rabbits need a fellow rabbit companion, neutering is essential for relationship harmony too."

In fact it would be better to actually encourage greater hay consumption before an operation so the gut is full of fibre whilst the rabbit recovers. Rabbits are unable to vomit so the concern of choking during surgery is simply not present. Speak with your rabbit specialist vet prior to any surgery if you have any concerns on the right pre-surgical preparation."

		"heading":"P is for Portion Control",
		"info":"To ensure the right daily hay intake (about 80% of the daily food intake), the amount of other foods fed, such as vegetables, treats and commercial rabbit feeds should be fed sparingly to ensure hay consumption is maintained – rabbits will happily fill up on pellets or veg rather than hay if they can; adopting portion control will help to ensure a high hay consumption is maintained. The ideal portion controlled diet contains around 80% hay, 15% vegetables and around 5% pellets."

That enclosure must prevent them from being able to escape (remember rabbits can dig and jump!), prevent them from being attacked (from the ground and air – and remember foxes can also dig), and prevent them from being stolen too. Strong weld mesh (not chicken wire..this doesn’t even keep chickens safe), locking bolts or padlocks, run on hard standing and a fully enclosed hutch and run constructed out of strong wood is required."

Firt pinpointed in China in 1983 and in 1992 in the UK, this is a dreadful disease, killing rapidly, often without any external symptoms before death occurs, which is often as little as 12 to 36 hours after infection. Transmission is via the eyes, nose or mouth, and secretions (urine, mucus etc) can transmit the virus in addition to biting insects such as fleas or mosquitoes. As with Myxomatosis, a vaccine is available (recently combined with Myxomatosis for a single annual dual protection vaccine), which all domestic rabbits should receive. Again,prevention against this dreadful disease is the only cure."

Apart from the plastic being bad for their digestion, their wire eating habits means they run a great risk of being electrocuted, which can – of course – be fatal. All wires should be encased in non-chewable trunking and kept well away from inquisitive mouths."

This has had significant impact on the longevity of our domestic rabbits, with the lifespan now reaching 10 years or more in some breeds.

Some bacterial infections such as Pasteurella and Salmonella  are transmittable, but it is worth remembering that although a rabbit disease may not be a zoonoses, us humans can easily transmit rabbit diseases (such as EC) form one rabbit to another. Cleanliness and good housekeeping is essential."
